Supabase is used for all database queries.

This is a Next.js project with both server and client side routes.
Client side components are marked with `"use client"`.

Client side:
Use `lib/supabase/client.ts` for Supabase (no elevated privileges).

Server side:
Use `lib/supabase/server.ts` (called `supabaseAdmin`) with elevated privileges.

Auth uses OTP (one-time password).
Send the OTP using client-side Supabase.
Verify the code using a server-side `/verify` route.
Auth context is in `auth-provider.tsx`.
To access user on the client side, use:
`const { user } = useAuth()`

The full database schema is in `types/supabase.d.ts`.
Always check this when writing database queries.
To type-check something we return, import from it and use:
`Tables<"specific_table">`
